# HMM Parts-of-Speech Tagging
Hidden Markov Models for parts-of-speech tagging.

1. Implemented a majority-class baseline for the Brown corpus. For each word in the test set, assigned the tag that is most frequently associated with that word in the training corpus. Tag out-of-vocabulary words as NN.

2. Implemented an HMM Tagger for Parts-of-speech tagging.

3. Implemented beam search to speed up Viterbi decoding.
